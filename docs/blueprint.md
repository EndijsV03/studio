## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Professional medium blue (#2962FF) for trust and reliability. This provides a balance between approachability and competence, fitting for business use.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F2F5), close to white but slightly desaturated, to reduce eye strain and give a clean look. Provides good contrast for a modern, comfortable feel.
- Accent color: Light Blue (#73A5FF), is a harmonious hue that reinforces the professional but modern theme. The softer tint makes it effective for highlighting interactive elements without overpowering the overall design.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text. This font choice creates a balance between providing a neutral appearance while offering excellent readability for various text elements.
- Use a consistent set of professional, minimalist icons to represent actions and data fields. These icons should be easily recognizable and contribute to the overall clean aesthetic.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for displaying contact information, ensuring a visually organized and easily navigable interface. Each card will represent a contact, clearly displaying the extracted information and providing quick access to editing and additional details.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance the user experience without being distracting. These could include slight fades or slides when navigating between views or saving data.
